# Next Compiled License Checker

This repo is a simple (hacky) script to collect all of the packages that are contained with the Next.JS compiled folder.

Vercel doesn't report these stats themselves, so this repo aims to collect these stats itself and then update this README.md file with those stats.

Take a look below:
